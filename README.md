## ðŸ“˜ OmniPath How-To Guide

### How to Update the JSON File with New Destinations
  - Open `north_spine_locations.json` in a text/code editor.
  - Add a new destination entry with the following format (compulsory fields):
  ```json
  {
    "name" : "The Location Name",
    "address" : "Level - L1",
    "latitude" : 1.123,
    "longitude" : 103.123,
    "level" : 0
  }
  ```
  - If ran locally, restart the server and re-run `python3 waitress_server.py`
  - If deployed on server (e.g. render.com for our case), push to the tracked repository and let the set CI/CD pipelines run.
### How to Test if the Navigation Server is Working
  - To test the `get_lift` endpoint, an example would be the following if the server ran at `http:://0.0.0.0:8080` :
    ```bash
    curl  -X POST http://0.0.0.0:8080/api/get-stairs \
          -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
          -d '{"origin": "LT8 (NS)", "dest": "LT9 (NS)"}'
    ```
    The 'd' flag contains a JSON payload with fields "origin" and "dest". The values must be exactly as written in the `north_spine_locations.json`
### How to Replace a QR Code at a Physical Location 
  - Identify the original anchor point.
  - Reprint and laminate the QR code.
  - Reinstall it in the same location.
  - Test the scan to confirm it works.
### How to Recalibrate AR Path if Misaligned 
  - Rescan the QR code under good lighting.
  - Restart the app if needed.
  - Adjust the QR placement and update coordinates if required.
### How to Add a New Feature to the UI
  - Open the Unity project.
  - Create UI elements under Canvas.
  - Write and attach C# scripts.
  - Connect in Unity Inspector and test before deployment.
### How to Deploy a New Version of the App
  - Finalize changes in Unity and Flask.
  - Export the iOS build and open in Xcode.
  - Archive and upload to TestFlight/App Store Connect.
  - Monitor and notify users.
